📊 **AI ALTCOIN MOMENTUM STRATEGY INSIGHTS** 📊

We tested buying the top 3 AI coins by 24H performance - here's what we found:

**PERFORMANCE:**
• Daily rebalancing approach: -34.4% 📉
• Static hold approach: -68.7% 📉
• Best individual coin: $BILLY (-19.1%)
• Worst performers: FOMO (-92.2%) and ⌘ (-94.8%)

**WHY IT DOESN'T WORK:**
1️⃣ We're buying at local price peaks after pumps
2️⃣ Mean reversion kicks in (what goes up must come down)
3️⃣ Playing "hot potato" - buying from early investors who are selling
4️⃣ Extreme volatility (562% annually!) without sustained direction

**HISTORICAL PATTERN:**
• Today's winners rarely remain tomorrow's winners
• Top performers completely change almost daily
• After big pumps (+25% to +148%), corrections usually follow

**BETTER APPROACHES:**
• Target early-stage momentum (2-5% gains) instead of chasing big pumps
• Add technical confirmation before entry
• Hold positions longer (3-7 days minimum)
• Include fundamental analysis of projects

**CONCLUSION:** Chasing yesterday's biggest gainers is generally a losing strategy in crypto. For profitable momentum trading, we need to catch trends earlier and use additional filters.
