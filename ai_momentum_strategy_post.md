# üìà AI Altcoin Momentum Strategy Backtest üìâ

## Strategy Description

I've backtested a simple momentum strategy on the top AI altcoins with the following rules:

- **Look-back window:** Daily rebalancing based on 24H performance
- **Entry criteria:** Go long on the top three AI coins by 24-hour performance
- **Exit criteria:** Close the position when either (a) the coin drops out of the daily top-three list or (b) its trailing 14-day return turns negative
- **Backtest period:** Past 90 days
